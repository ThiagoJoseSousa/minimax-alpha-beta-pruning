# minimax-alpha-beta-pruning
A study to better comprehend these algorithms and maybe implement in chess. Next is iterative deepening.

minimax: every player worsens the other player value. Alpha pruning: The player already knows that the value the other's gonna return only gets worse than the value it's returned. So dont even get the others.
